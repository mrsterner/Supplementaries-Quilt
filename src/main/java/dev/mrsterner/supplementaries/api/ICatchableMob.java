 * You can copy this class into your mod and implement this interface into your entity class
 * or provide its capability, both work
 * <p>
 * note that all this class will need to store its entity instance to be able to work on it. Refer to BaseCatchableMobCap for a basic implementation
 * Such entity will only be visual tho since the actual entity that will be released is kept frozen and saved in nbt
 * The actual entity data that is stored inside the container is kept unaltered and isn't related to the entity passed here, which is only needed for display purposes
 * It is possible to access and modify such data in the two client/server sided methods here provided: tickInsideContainer() and onPlayerInteract().
